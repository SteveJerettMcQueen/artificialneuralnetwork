# Learning to Classify Text Using an Artificial Neural Network

The purpose of this project is to apply a known supervised classification 
technique for Natural Language Processing problems. Specifically, 
the supervised classification technique used for this problem will be an
Artificial Neural Network (a computational model based on the structure and
functions of a biological neural network)
